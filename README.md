## the official button of glitchâ„¢

Users can already remix any public app on Glitch, and we want to give project owners control over their app's look,
          so we do not force buttons into any apps. What we do want, though, is for our community to <em>encourage</em> 
          others to remix and learn more about their apps, so we built a widget that you can include in your projects to generate 
          our neat little button wherever you like.
          
Read how to add the button manually to your projects here (and you can also add it in the editor via the "share button."

## developer notes

To build any project updates, run `node grunt.js` on any js or css changes to minify the code. Any questions should be sent to [Jenn](https://glitch.com/@jennschiffer)!

The button is not rendered on private projects or projects that have custom domains.
