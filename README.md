Glitch Button Embed
=========================

By adding the following snippet to a project's view...

`<script src="https://button.glitch.me/button.js"></script>`

...the Glitch button will be appended to any element with `class="glitchButton"`.

[Read the documentation for more info on how to add this to your project!](https://button.glitch.me)

## Development

The button script is in `src/button.js` and after any changes you should run `grunt` in the application console
